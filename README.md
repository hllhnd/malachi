Quick and dirty system information fetcher.

# Missing Support
Most CPUs and GPUs are either subtly broken (have redundant or unwanted details (e.g. extra parentheses (insert self-aware joke here)) or missing details) or straight up don't work (non-x86).

Wide support is prioritized, but I won't work on hardware that I haven't been requested to fix. If your hardware produces broken or suboptimal results, please file an issue and I'll try to add support.
